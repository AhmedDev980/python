Virtual environment is used to create a separate space for each project in the machine.
We can create this using 
   pip install virtualenv ( it will create the virtual enivironment )
     python -m venv project_1 ( it will create the separate space for project_1 in virtual machine )
       source project_1/bin/activate  ( to activate the project_1 space to work on )
       pip install jira ( it will install jira in project_1 space )
       deactivate ( we will come out of the project_1 space )
If we want to install s3 in another project space then we will follow as below
     python -m venv project_2 ( it will create the separate space for project_1 in virtual machine )
       source project_2/bin/activate  ( to activate the project_2 space to work on )
       pip install s3 ( it will install s3 in project_2 space )
       deactivate ( we will come out of the project_2 space )

If we want to give password and that needs to be invisible in terminal then we can do
  export password="bhjvhjb"
For env we will use os. So we need to give import os
print(os.getenv("password"))
Then while running u can call the file name < python filename.py >
